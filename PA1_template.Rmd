###**This is an R Markdown document of the 1st project in the reproducible research course on Coursera.**

**1. First Ill start off by improting the data which is stored in a csv file and Ill store it in a variable named data.**

```{r}
data<-read.csv("C:/Users/JeetsPC-1/Desktop/Study Material/R DataSets/activity.csv")
data$date=as.Date(data$date)
```

**2. Now that the data has been imported, I'll make a histogram of total number of steps taken each day. I'll store the number of steps each day in a vecor variable "steps"**

```{r}
steps<-tapply(data$steps,data$date,sum)
hist(steps)
```

Therefore by looking at this histogram we can say that it has a normal distribution and the user takes between 10000-15000 steps on an average days. The user took 10000-15000 steps on 25+ days.


**3. Now we'll calculate the mean and median number of steps taken each day from the variable steps**
```{r}
mean(steps,na.rm = TRUE)
median(steps,na.rm = TRUE)
```

**4. Now We'll make a time series plot of the average number of steps taken by using the plot function**
```{r}
average<-tapply(data$steps,data$date,mean)
plot(average,type = "l")
```

**5. Now We'll calculate the 5 minute interval that, on average, contains the maximum number of steps**

```{r}
library(lubridate)
library(zoo)
data$datetime= as.POSIXct(data$date+minutes(data$interval))
data$interval<-factor(data$interval)
maxint<-aggregate(data=data,steps~date+interval,FUN="mean")
maxint2<-aggregate(data=maxint,steps~interval,FUN="max")
max(maxint2$steps)
```
Therefore we can see that interval 615 has maximum steps of 806. The whole data table is stored in maxint2 variable

**6. Now We'll try to impute the data of missing values. The function we'll use for this is na.omit(). We'll store this new data in data1**

```{r}
data1<-na.omit(data)
data1$date<-as.Date(data1$date)
```

**7. Now We'll run a code to make a histogram of number of steps taken after missing values have been imputed**

```{r}
data1<-na.omit(data)
steps1<-tapply(data1$steps,data1$date,sum)
hist(steps1)
```
Again the histogram indicated that the user usually takes between 10000-15000 days on an average day. The least occurance is of the user taking over 20000 steps which only happened on 2 days.

**8. Now We'll make a panel plot comparing the average number of steps taken per 5-minute interval across weekdays and weekendsd**
```{r}
data1$weekday<-weekdays(data1$date)
data1$isweekday<-ifelse(data1$weekday=="Friday"|data1$weekday=="Saturday"|data1$weekday=="Sunday","weekend","weekday")
library(ggplot2)

data$interval<-factor(data$interval)
maxinterval<-aggregate(data=data1,steps~date+interval,FUN="mean")
maxinterval2<-aggregate(data=maxinterval,steps~interval,FUN="max")

ggplot(maxinterval2,aes(steps))+geom_histogram()
```
